Every time system restarts the wireguard interface is removed (including peers)
- Upon system start run the wireguard_server_setup.sh script from the connect/tetherctl folder
- If you want to remove the interface check the end of the script
- Current problem is that peers are obviously lost upon reboot so maybe we need a way to setup a config file everytime an interface is changed or a peer is added
- So that upon reboot this file can be used to start wireguard. Can use linux services to enable on startup
Need a way to assign the next available ip per peer


// TODOs include:
- integrate WG routing with BY tunnel
- setup config/service for automatic startup
- decide how allowed ips are given 
- look into ipv6 addresses
- add tests for tether package
